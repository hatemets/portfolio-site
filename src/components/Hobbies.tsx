                        Racket sports have fascinated me for as long as I can remember. I'm especially fond of tennis, as I occasionally even compete in smaller tournaments.
                        I'm also a huge fan of table tennis, which I've played since I was 8.

                        As nerdy as it sounds, I genuinely enjoy tweaking my workspace to make it aesthetically pleasing and optimize it for productivity.
                        Most of the development I do on Linux with the Vim text editor, which allows me to customize my environment to my liking.

                        I've had the opportunity to learn several fascinating languages, which include Estonian, English, Russian, Finnish and some Spanish.
                        Consuming content from each language offers a unique cultural experience, which can't be achieved by copy-pasting the text to Google Translate.
                        To that end, I'm always eager to try and talk to natives in their mother tongue.

                        To my mind, there's no better way to spend a sunny day than to go cycling and/or motorcycling.
                        The feeling of wind blowing against your face while enjoying the view is something that's difficult to imagine without trying it.
